# Medical Image Classification Using KNN

## Overview
This project aims to develop a tool for classifying medical images (tumor CT/MRI, Covid-19 lung CT, PET tumor datasets) using the K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) algorithm.

## Objectives
- Implement a KNN classifier to categorize medical images.
- Optimize and evaluate the classifier using metrics like accuracy and F1-score.

## Dataset
- **Training set**: To train the KNN model.
- **Validation set**: To validate model performance.

## Implementation Steps
1. **Acquire Dataset**: Secure a quality dataset suitable for KNN.
2. **Implement KNN**: Develop the algorithm focusing on distance calculations and neighbor classification.
3. **Optimize Parameters**: Fine-tune KNN settings such as the number of neighbors.
4. **Train and Validate**: Train the model and validate using performance metrics.
5. **Iterate**: Refine training and validation to enhance model accuracy.

## Tools
- **Languages**: Python 3.x
- **Libraries**: `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
